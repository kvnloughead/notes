For next position practice meeting

- Do we want to keep the numbers for each block?
- upper-left corner as navigation?
- fonts for paragraphs, YS 18px works, but it also says Menlo 14.4px?
- monospace font for code?
- I was going to make the expected result images with modifiers, but this might be confusing, or give away answers
