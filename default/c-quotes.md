- A character in single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character in the machine's character set (called a _character constant_)

- A character in double quotes is a single-character string, not an integer value

- So `'\n'` is a single character with value `10`, while `"\n"` is a string comprised of just a single newline character
