# Repo for command-line-notes

This repo stores the notes for the 
[command-line-notes](https://github.com/kvnloughead/command-line-notes) application. Notes can be 
pushed to GitHub with the `cln push` command. 

First time setup is explained in the application's readme. Setting up on a new device is a bit more
complicated.

## Setup new device instructions

```
mkdir -p ~/.cln/notes
cd ~/.cln/notes 
git init
git remote add origin your-notes-repo
git pull origin main
```
